# Testing
Privado is an open-source static code analysis tool to discover data flows in the code. The application detects more than 110 personal data elements being processed and further maps the data flow from the point of collection to "sinks" such as external third parties, databases, logs, and internal APIs.
Supported languages
Currently, only Java is supported, but JS/TS support is arriving soon! We're also working on modifying the architecture to make it easier to accept community contributions to language support in the near future.
